Project Desc:
A vanilla JS API w/ crud functionality that reads, writes, etc from a JSON file. It does not use Express or any such framework. This is bare bones and intended to teach some basic API concepts. This is inspired from a tutorial the video of which is called "Vanilla Node.js REST API | No framework" by Traversy Media. It can be found on YT.

Because of our lack of a framework we will be writing more code then is typical these days concerning HTTP request/response cycles, routing, how to structure code, methods used, etc. Will do it all manually, so while its a big harder if means you'll actually walk away knowing what Express is doing under the hood, as well as a gratiude for the time saved by using it.
